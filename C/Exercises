 Write a program in C++ to find Size of fundamental data types. 
Sample Output:
Find Size of fundamental data types : 
------------------------------------------ 
The sizeof(char) is : 1 bytes 
The sizeof(short) is : 2 bytes
The sizeof(int) is : 4 bytes 
The sizeof(long) is : 8 bytes 
The sizeof(long long) is : 8 bytes 
The sizeof(float) is : 4 bytes 
The sizeof(double) is : 8 bytes 
The sizeof(long double) is : 16 bytes 
The sizeof(bool) is : 1 bytes
